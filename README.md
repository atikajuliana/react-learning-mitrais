### **React Learning** [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/enaqx/awesome-react.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/enaqx/awesome-react)

This react learning is based on Mitrais CDC JS experience and idea on [Pete Hunt react-howto](https://github.com/petehunt/react-howto)

If you’re new to React (or frontend in general) you may find the ecosystem confusing. There are a few reasons for this.

- React has historically been targeted at early-adopters and experts
- Facebook only open-sources what it actually uses, so it doesn’t focus on tooling for smaller-than-Facebook projects
- There’s a lot of bad marketing masquerading as React guides

### How to tackle the React ecosystem

All software is built on a stack of technologies, and you need to understand enough of that stack to build your app. The reason why the React ecosystem of tooling seems overwhelming is because it’s always explained in the wrong order.

You should learn, in this order, without skipping ahead or learning concurrently:

- React itself
- JavaScript “bundlers” (e.g. Webpack)
- ES6
- Redux

You don't need to learn all of these to be productive with React. Only move to the next step if you have a problem that needs to be solved.

Additionally, there are a few topics that are often mentioned in the React community that are "bleeding edge". The topics below are interesting, but they're difficult to understand, are far less popular than the above topics and aren't required for most apps.

    Inline styles
    Server rendering
    Immutable.js
    Relay, Falcor, etc
